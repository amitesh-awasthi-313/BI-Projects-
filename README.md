# 📊 BI Tools Projects Repository

Welcome to the **BI Tools Projects** repository! 👋

I'm **Amitesh Awasthi**, a data analyst at **Appsquadz Software Pvt. Ltd.** working on building powerful, insightful, and scalable BI solutions. This repo is a curated collection of my real-world and learning-based projects using tools like **Power BI**, **Metabase**, **AWS Athena**, and **Glue**. Each project here demonstrates my approach to solving business problems with data, from data ingestion to interactive dashboards.

- **AWS Athena & Glue** for querying and processing data
- **Power BI** and **Metabase** for building BI dashboards
- **SQL (Athena, MySQL)** for advanced data modeling
- **Python (Pandas, Boto3)** for scripting and automation

🔧 I'm also exploring **AI/ML** and **data engineering pipelines**.
